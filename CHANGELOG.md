# Version 0.3 Changes  

### Added / Changed  

- Keplerian Orbits for more stable orbits with orbital mechanics
- Orbit Visualization
- Editor Changed to Dropdown menus for cleaner look

### Bug Fixes

- Gravitational Singularity is no longer a **major** issue due to the implementation of stable keplerian orbits

# Version 0.2 Changes

### Added / Changed

- Adaptive Simulaton Bounds for more performance (although quite unstable as gravitational singularity can fling objects tens of thousands of unity meters away)
- Unity Custom Editor and Readability Changes  

# Version 0.1 Changes

### Added / Changed

- Added Barnes-Hut Algorithm for O(n log n) time complexity of force calculation  
- Implemented realistic scaling for mass, force, and distance units  
- Increased Precision by switching from Floating-point to Double-precision

### Bug Fixes

- Tweaked Simulation timesteps for smoother integration
